Application cycles are soon coming into full swing. The first round of application deadlines for most programmes are either in January or February 2022. I recall embarking on a similar process last October in an attempt to answer the question - if given a free choice - which Business Analytics programme should I pick? This article is put together to help prospective students make the same choice I was faced with.

I intend to keep this article brief to leave room for a more comprehensive exploration when time permits. As a start, I'm looking to answer the "question" along these dimensions:

1. Which countries have the most well-ranked programmes?
2. Where are the odds of finding a job better?
3. Which programmes provide the quickest return on investment?

In recent years, the number of Business Analytics programmes have risen substantially. Just in the US alone, the number of Analytics and Data Science Masters have been increasing from merely 10+ in 2012 to 310+ in 2021. The Advanced Institute for Analytics shares this nifty graphic below. I expect that this trend is the same for the rest of the world too.

With more schools and prospective students seeking to jump on the bandwagon - I'd imagine that there will be more people looking and comparing programmes. Hopefully, this resource adds to your list of materials to help prospective students decide which schools to apply to and eventually pick.

# Approach and Basis

For an initial study, I relied on publicly and readily available data. This comprises the [QS Business Analytics Rankings for 2022](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/business-masters-rankings/business-analytics/2022) and the respective programme's websites. For data from QS, I relied on published ranking indicators. No adjustments were made to their [methodology](https://www.topuniversities.com/business-masters-rankings/methodology).

There was some missing information to furnish. Beyond rank 50, an overall score is not given. Schools are ranked within bands (e.g. 51-60, 61-70, etc.). To obtain a complete set of ranking information, I ran a regression model to furnish the information. The model was trained based on overall scores from schools ranked 1 to 50. This dataset is available upon request.

I proceeded to extract specific attributes, where available, from the respective programme's websites. In the interest of time, I only scrawled the websites of the Top 20 schools. There is an inconsistency between the information publicly available. For example, some acceptance rates for UK schools are available online due to the UK's Freedom of Information Act. However, this is not available for most schools. In addition, not all schools publish information on their alumni salaries, employment rates, etc. While expected, these constraints limit the extent of insights derived.

Nevertheless, here are some interesting points I found.

# Findings

## Singapore, France, and Canada have the most well-ranked programmes

![Average ranks of courses](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQEtIeTDm_ONtg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1637331518710?e=1727308800&v=beta&t=w5y8uxOWu3S4cvu3__dmIClpM_wP_pUtucXl3E0PiNk)

While the average scores in Singapore (Average Score: 69.05), France (Average Score: 64.54), and Canada (Average Score: 63.93) were the highest, the United States (59 programmes) and the United Kingdom (18 programmes) have the most number of programmes ranked in US rankings. These top destinations have different strengths:

* France, with nine programmes ranked, comes close to being the most "Value for Money" (#2) and for "Diversity" (#4) in its cohorts. It is also home to the Trois Parisiennes: [HEC-X](https://www.hec.edu/en/master-s-programs/x-hec-programs/msc-data-science-business-x-hec) (#3 Overall), [ESSEC-CS](https://www.essec.edu/en/program/mscs/master-data-sciences-business-analytics/careers/) (#4 Overall), and [ESCP](https://www.escp.eu/programmes/specialised-masters-MScs/MSc-in-Big-Data-and-Business-Analytics) (#6 Overall).
* Singapore, with two programmes ranked, ranks favourably for having the best "Employability" (#2), "Thought Leadership" (#1) and "Alumni Outcomes" (#1).
* The United States boasts some of the top programmes - in overall score and thought leadership - [MIT's MBAn](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/master-of-business-analytics#career-path) and [UCLA's MScBA](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/degrees/master-of-science-in-business-analytics),
* The United Kingdom bodes well for "Diversity" (#3) in its programmes and is home to [Imperial's MScBA](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/programmes/msc-business-analytics/career-impact/), which has steadily held its place in the Top 5 programmes since the ranking's inception.

The launching of Business Analytics programmes is a recent phenomenon. The QS Ranking for this programme started only in 2019, with some of the most highly ranked programmes having begun only in 2016.
This trend could be tied closely with governmental policies - the scale and scope. These policies determine the industrial focus and what ecosystem gets developed. Incorporating analytics, after all, has a very practical and application-based aspect to it. It depends on whether organisations are open to embracing a new way of analysing information. Singapore's "[Smart Nation](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/about-smart-nation/transforming-singapore)" initiative - to incorporate data and technology into government operations, France's "[La French Tech](https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/la-french-tech)" - to spur the development of French tech start-ups, and Canada's [investment prioritisation](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-countries-leading-the-data-science-dominance-in-2021/) of data technologies all have a part to play in this.

## Schools which are Thought Leaders Enjoy Better Employability

There is a moderate positive relationship between thought leadership and employability (R-square: 0.72) of the school's programmes.

It is no surprise that MIT's MBAn ranks top for "Thought Leadership" (#1, Score: 100) and has nearly the best "Employability" (#2, Score: 99.2). Their students engage in an [Analytics Capstone](https://www.analyticscapstone.mit.edu/project-archive/all-projects) where they perform and present their analytics projects on companies to the public realm.

The next that comes close is HEC-X's [MSc in Data Science](https://www.hec.edu/en/master-s-programs/x-hec-programs/msc-data-science-business-x-hec) for Business programme. This programme was first ranked in the 2022 rankings. This programme is a powerhouse collaboration between one of the best business schools (HEC) and one of the best engineering schools (Ã‰cole Polytechnique, also known as "X") in France. There isn't much publicly available information yet, but we'll keep our eyes peeled.

Generally, when looking at schools, it'd be good to take a look at the professors that are affiliated with the course and their research interests. Often, these programmes have an option or require you to undertake a research project. That, too, contributes to the thought leadership of the programme.

## Amongst the Top 20, Schools in the EU have the fastest ROI

![Image to Earn](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQFnPZEr5CghRw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1637610120315?e=1727308800&v=beta&t=TGWDoF3cODGF5C00-wflakSwd5rrfWJdCBxon_NbifI)

While every effort was made to find data from the programme's websites, not all schools disclosed the starting salary of their graduates. However, I still managed to collect some data points to show it here. "Time to Earn" is derived by dividing the fees by the starting salary. This does not take into account the respective jurisdiction's tax nor the time value of money.

From the Top 20 schools, it appears:

* European (ex-UK) schools have the cheapest fees. That being said the graduation salary is also one of the lowest amongst all the programmes.
* Graduates from schools in the United States enjoy the highest employment salaries (>US$100,000) amongst the Top 20 schools. It comes at a hefty price, as most programmes are priced in the US$60,000 range.
* The top "Value for Money" schools are in Norway and France.

![Value for Money by Country](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQE0cKJVny17sg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1637610518389?e=1727308800&v=beta&t=cb6_3hhg73iWIvHUHa4WwrmpMeh3_4pHVIS_uavbpes)

I would opine that having a higher starting salary is better in the long run, because after repaying the cost of the programme's tuition fees, there's more to keep.

That being said, I found that European schools generally had more scholarship options available. UK schools feature a broad array of school-based scholarships. For government scholarships - the UK Government's [Chevening Scholarship](https://www.chevening.org/apply/) (which closes early) or the French Government's [Eiffel Master Scholarship](https://www.campusfrance.org/en/eiffel-scholarship-program-of-excellence) are two places to start your search.

# Concluding Thoughts

Every programme has a slightly different slant. For example, some have a heavier focus on "Data Science", whereas others focus on "Business Analytics". The programmes at ESSEC-CS and ESCP also feature an "International Seminar" - a study mission to another city. So, in this regard, there are different dimensions to make this decision from when making your choice.

But beyond the discussion on which school to pick, it may also be worth exploring your motivations for doing a Masters programme. It could be to gain access to a new market, acquire new skills, or any other reason. The decision becomes slightly easier to make once you have figured out what you would like to prioritise.

Having gone through this cycle - I'm always happy to share some thoughts on this topic. Feel free to reach me if you'd like to have a chat!
